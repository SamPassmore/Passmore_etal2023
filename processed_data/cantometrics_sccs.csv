The Tribe then  as it is now  was composed of four distinct bands: the Chaui “Grand ” the Kitkehahki “Republican ” the Pitahawirata “Tappage” and the Skidi “Wolf.” After encroachment by white settlers  the Pawnees ceded their territory to the U.S. Government in the 1800s and were removed from Nebraska to what is now Pawnee Cty in 1875. The Chahiksichahiks resisted leaving their homelands in southeast Nebraska until the 1870s  when white settlers  dwindling bison herds  and inter-tribal conflicts drove them to relocate in Oklahoma. Originally an agricultural society  they established permanent villages of earthlodge homes.

Today  it is a strongly hierarchical pastoral culture. The first livestock arrived from Europe around the beginning of the sixteenth century. Hungry  curious  and adventurous  some of the Wayuu obtained livestock by raid and theft until they had semi-wild herds of cattle and horses. Pastoralism progressively became widespread  probably facilitated by missionaries  who made many attempts at pacification; by pirates hostile to the Spanish and in quest of food; and by Black slaves who  by choice or by force  settled among the Wayuu.

Hungry  curious  and adventurous  some of the Wayuu obtained livestock by raid and theft until they had semi-wild herds of cattle and horses. Pastoralism progressively became widespread  probably facilitated by missionaries  who made many attempts at pacification; by pirates hostile to the Spanish and in quest of food; and by Black slaves who  by choice or by force  settled among the Wayuu.
