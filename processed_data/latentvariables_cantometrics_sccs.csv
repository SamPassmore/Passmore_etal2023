Religion is the core of Balinese life and there are many rituals and ceremonies observed throughout the year  which are concerned with maintaining a balance between positive and negative forces. Their religion features a mix of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs combined with Balinese animistic traditions. Balinese people believe that good spirits reside in the mountains and demons in the sea.

The island of Bali is surrounded by coral reefs and the livelihood of its people comes mostly from agriculture and fishing. Religion is the core of Balinese life and there are many rituals and ceremonies observed throughout the year  which are concerned with maintaining a balance between positive and negative forces. Their religion features a mix of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs combined with Balinese animistic traditions. Balinese people believe that good spirits reside in the mountains and demons in the sea.

The presence of a Songman in a camp means social life  joy and  more deeply  being caught up in the traditions and life of the heroic past. The theme of the Gunborg is gossip. The Songman composes the words on some passing event in social happenings such as in love affairs  but makes the allusions indirect  so as to avoid trouble. Moreover  the words frequently have a latent meaning  usually with sexual significance.The sample of which two verses are given  states that the Songman wanted his female cousin  and that they came out (from the camp).
