The Bauls belong to a syncretic mystic cult of wandering mendicants in Bengal and Bangladesh. Their ideas are influenced by Vaishnava Hinduism and Sufi Islam as well as by Tantric Buddhism. Perhaps because of their unconventional beliefs  the word baul is said to mean “one who is crazy.” There are many cults of wandering musicians in India  all with their own philosophical and mystical underpinnings that are reflected in their unique lifestyles  clothing  songs and even the instruments they use. Bauls frequently travel alone and although accompaniment on the dotåra (lit. “two - stringed” but often having four strings  as in this instance) is not unusual  they more often accompany themselves on khamak (a variable - tension chordophone that may often described as a plucked drum) or ektårå (monochord) and simultaneously play a small drum (∂ugg¥) as they sing and dance. In recent times they have achieved international recognition  and Baul performers have toured widely  and their ensembles now often include instruments such as the harmonium and khol (double conical drum) as well as small cym bals and clappers.","Haripada Devanath  accompanying himself on dotar","Male Voice; Dotar","Men","The translation of the Baul song as given by Danielou is as follows:  The mind’s helmsman cannot at his fancy guide  his own craft. Unaware of the current You start the voyage to the other shore.  Taking the wealth you received from the Great Lord  you  started your trip on the ocean of lust.  The words of Eros murmured by the striking waves  will break your craft  and nothing will be left.  The mind’s helmsman cannot at his fancy guide his own craft. Make the door of prayer the way to salvation. Hold your boat with the divine name Do not try for the shore which lust suggests And you will fear no storm or tempest.  The mind’s helsman cannot at his fancy guide his own craft.  But the mad helmsman is not ready [to hear]. It starts across in the storm and wind Where wait for him the six enemy boatmen [lust  anger  greed illusion  envy  and vanity].  The mind’s helmsman cannot at his fancy guide his own craft.","nan","Alain Daniélou","1953","Columbia Records","Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: India.

Dancers have a various collection of dances  as well as comic and serious. In every repertoire of performances  a dancer mimics a hunted deer. The movements of the deer are realistically imitated as he grazes and then picks up his head to look around or violently leaps away  consistently with nervousness of a startled animal.   Three or four musicians accompany the Deer dancer by singing the deer song in low-pictched voices in unison and playing on notched rasping sticks and the water drum. The rasping stick is a notched strip of wood played by setting down one of the ends on an inverted half gourd and stroking it with another stick. The water drum  that used in this recording  is an unusually interesting instrument. It consists of a half gourd laying on the surface with the open side downward in a wooden bowl filled with water and beaten accordingly with the rasping sticks.

The number of players varies from two to as many as twenty. The players sit crosslegged or kneel on the ground facing each other  usually six to eight on each team. Between them is a row of ten sticks standing upright in the ground. One of the players holds two cylindrical pieces of bone  each small enough for the hand to conceal. One of the bones is distinguished by a black ring around the middle. The object of the game is to guess which hand conceals the unmarked bone. When each player has contributed his money to the pot they draw to see which team will have the bones first. The team in possession then starts singing one of the hundreds of songs which traditionally accompany the game  each player beating in time with a stick on a long pole or board lying in front of the players. One of the players however  doesn't beat the pole for he has the bones and is going through all sorts of gyrations and trick passes to fool the opponents. Satisfied that his tricks have fooled the opposing players he holds both arms out  inviting a player on the opposite side to guess which hand contains the unmarked bone. If the guess is wrong the same side retains the bones and takes one of the ten sticks. The procedure is repeated perhaps to the accompaniment of another song. If the guess is correct  however  one of the sticks goes to the successful side and they gain possession of the bones. The game is Continued until one side has all the sticks. The Cree hand-game songs are distinguished by a series of rhythmic grunts which are sometimes interpolated between verses. Other tribes do not use this device. The songs are always fast and steady rhythmically. It is most unusual for women to play the game  though they often watch and can sing many of the songs. The game is sometimes played ceremonially by elders and medicine men and a special group of Holy Hand-Game Songs is used for this purpose. It is considered sacrilegious to use these songs for the popular game of course. Although the game can be played with improvised sticks and bones  some of the sets are elaborately carved in ivory as family heirlooms  especially those used for Holy Hand-Games.

Originally danced only by a select group of warriors who were used as ""shock troops ""  it has degenerated into a tourist display of colorful costumes and plumage. The basic costume consists of full length tights in black or some brilliant color  adorned with fancy belts  aprons  ankle bells  knee-bells  armlets  feathers  and pieces of fur. The head-dress is made of brilliant cloth and ornaments topped with a plume of porcupine quills or horse-hair. An eye-mask of fancy beads is often worn. While the music is similar from tribe to tribe  the costumes and dancing vary. In some tribes the spectacular Hoop Dance is inc luded under the general category of the Gra ss Dance. The dancer carries several hoops which he climbs through and rotates on his arms and legs. The example given here is traditional and is used for a specific purpose. If a dancer drops an armlet or some other part of his costume an old respected warrior picks it up and hands it to him to the accompaniment of this special music. It is somewhat faster than the usual Grass Dance which has a heavy  moderate beat. As in all Grass Dances  the volume of the drumming is heightened at the climax of each verse. Often the tempo of the music increases as the dance progresses but older men frown upon this unseemly innovation.","Male solo  hand-drum","Male Voice; Hand-Drum","Men","nan","nan","Kenneth Peacock  National Museum of Canada","1951-53","Smithsonian Folkways","Indian Music Of The Canadian Plains.

Recorded in Solveira  December 1952.  This appears to be the only romance (Hispanic narrative ballad) in Lomax’s Galicia collection. It and the next song (track 21) are both versions of the opening verses of the same ballad  sung in both cases as a plowing song  with refrain  by women in high  penetrating voices. The romance is “Adúltera con un ‘gato ’ closely related to Albaniña  a pan-European ballad known in English as “Our Goodman.” Texts very similar to this one and that on track 21 are also sung in Miranda do Douro  in northeastern Portugal  and among Bosnian Sephardic Jews. The husband returns home to find signs of an unauthorized male presence at his door  in his house and  finally  in his bed. His wife tries various ruses to cover up her infidelity: the priest’s cat is in the bed  she says  —  although it bears a suspicious resemblance to the priest himself. In some versions of the ballad  she triumphs  but in others  swords flash and heads fall. In neighboring Tras-os-Montes  Portugal  many romances are also sung with a slow tempo and repetitions adapted to accompany long  arduous agricultural tasks. —Ed.","Alan Lomax with Jeannette Bell","1952","Westminster","Spanish Recordings  ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection  American Folklife Center  Library of Congress",NA,"nan","Songs and Dances of Spain  Volume 8: Galicia.

","Jeannie Robertson","Female Voice","Women","Jeannie Robertson sings: There is a thornbush in oor kell-yard  There is a thornbush in oor kell-yard. At the back o’ thornbush there stands a lad and lass  But they’re busy  busy hairin’ at the cuckoo’s nest.  It is thorned  it is sprinkled — it is compassed all around  It is thorned  it is sprinkled  and it isn’t easy found. She said  “Young man  you’re plundering ” I said it was nae true  But I left her with the makin’s of a young cuckoo.  It’s hi the cuckin  ho the cuckin  hi the cuckoo’s nest  It’s hi the cuckin  ho the cuckin  hi the cuckoo’s nest. I’ll gie ony body a shilling and a bottle o’ the best  If they’ll ramble up the feathers of the cuckoo’s nest.

Their dancing in the forest is equally fine  in many respects a great deal finer  but it is accompanied only by song  sticks and handclaps. In the village they borrow drums  clappers and a mgungu gong.   A steady stick beat that never falters through the dance starts the music. The ""birds"" in the background are in fact Pygmies. The mgungu  drums and voices corne in together and the dance begins with little delay. The hooting sound which could be mistaken for horns is also made by Pygmies. They form a circle  women facing men. They hoot a chorus  with snatches of solo being passed from one to another  singing encouragement as each dancer leaps into the center and performs in turn. The dancing is a game between feet and drum  the drum leading the feet for a while  then the dancer suddenly syncopating his step and making the drum follow him. After displaying his virtuosity as a dancer he jigs along the line of girls and eventually leads one out into the center for a brisk whirl. Both return to their places and another couple takes the floor. As dancers the Pygmies are inexhaustible. Dancing by firelight into the early hours of the morning  they truly earn the title given them by the ancient Egyptians: The Dancers of God."" (Colin M. Turnbull and Francis S.

A garland of the best ears of grain is made by the virgins of the village. To the accompaniment of a ritual song  the wreath is carried to the cottage of the most hardworking peasant. There it is hung on a beam and kept until next seedtime  when its grains will be mixed with those about to be sown.  The processional song tells of a girl who  distracted by the good looks of her sweetheart  cuts herself with the scythe. At the end of the ceremony  the farmer is assured that the harvest has been plentiful and he is asked to be generous to his helpers. A party with music and dance is organized  and all relatives  friends  and neighbors are invited.","Group of village girls","Girls' Voices","Girls","Din sus de la rªsªrit  M<ndrª cunun-o pornit; Din jos de la ¶ªligrad  M<ndrª cunun-o plecat.

About 15 drummers are seated near a huge fire at which they repeatedly heat their tambor to raise the pitch. About sixty women dance in a circle around them  in a design sometimes snake-like sometimes star-shaped. The dance is repeated many times during the night; sometimes two girls dance solemnly in the center of the circle. The general pattern is as follows:   While the drummers ""warm up"" with cascades of beats  a woman tries a melody. The other women may not respond to the first theme  if so she tries another. When the choir takes it up  the song is considered ""mature"" (Until the song is ""matured"" the women cover their mouths with their hands lest a djinn enter.) Then starts a measured 4/4 rhythm and the dancing begins. After irregular sections of odd-numbered beats  the rhythm changes to 6/8 and gradually accellerates till the lead drummer rises and twirls his drum aloft. Then there is a shout  a roll of drums and silence. The musical scales consist of the first five notes  sometimes of major  sometimes of minor.""

This is especially true of the Crees who were always more fond of word songs than the other Plains tribes in Canada. Each year brings a new crop of pow-wow love songs in English  and during World War II  with so many Indians in the armed forces  it seemed more natural to tell of their exploits in English. Similar songs from the World War I period are all in Cree. However  whether the songs are traditional  transitional  or contemporary the musical idiom remains purely Indian. The combination of English words and Indian music creates strange off-beat accents that are faintlyreminiscent of calypso songs.","George Nicotine and group  hand drum","Male Voice; Voices; Hand Drum","Men","Translation:  Oh brave soldier boy  On the land  on the sea  and in the air  In Japan  Tokyo-o-o; Just the same I'm staying with you.","nan","Kenneth Peacock  National Museum of Canada","1951-53","Smithsonian Folkways","Indian Music Of The Canadian Plains.

They have distinct types of song for distinct activities. A Hunting Song can be distinguished by scale and technique from a Honey Song  or from the songs of the Elima or the Molima - the religious societies of women and men.   Hunting songs may be sung when setting out in the morning  but more often in the evening  after a meal around the camp fire. The men all eat together while the women and children eat outside their beehive-shaped huts. The forest all around is dark and silent  except for the crickets and frogs  and an occasional distant growl of some animal looking for a meal. The circular camp is lit by a large fire in the center  and a number of smaller fires  one outside each hut. The group of men in the center are the main singers  but sometimes the solo or even the chorus is passed around the circle of huts in canon form - one group taking over a measure before the other finishes. Clapped sticks are used for accompaniment -- either split at the end  or unsplit -- giving a harder  hollow sound.   In this elephant-hunting song split sticks are used to mark the time  and only the group of men and boys around the main fire sing. A couple of chords start them off  but then there is  as usual  a long warming-up period. The solo is taken up by two young hunters  overlapping  taking over from each other the story of the hunt. The chorus  very hesitant and uncertain to begin with  slowly gets under way  using the peculiar hooting technique in which each singer has one particular note which he hoots at the appropriate moment. Sometimes a singer will have two notes  and in this way a harmonic as well as a melodic pattern is passed around the circle.   As the chorus takes shape the soloist tells his simple story  occasionally breaking off to tell the others that they are putting up a pretty poor show  and he stands up ana begins to dance. The chorus and the split stick continue without change now  and the soloist  instead of singing  dances in the firelight and mimes the story of the elephant hunt. He ends this act with a series of yodels of satisfaction."" (Colin M. Turnbull and Francis S.

Recorded in Lagartera  December 24  1952. T764.3  2’46  Reapers often sang this ballad [#0161] as they worked the summer harvest. The melody sung here is very similar to one used for the reapers’ songs and for this region’s hernandillas songs  sung to the rhythm of the work: one person sings the story and the other or others respond with the refrain. In other La Mancha areas  the ballad is also sung  often as part of the Christmas season repertoire. It also appears in neighboring Extremadura (Rounder 1700) and several other parts of the Luso-Hispanic world  including the Sephardic tradition. This is a fragment of the ballad  in which a lady tells a reaper to go ahead and “reap”. At midnight he sighs “my sickles are broken  I won't be able to reap tomorrow.” She offers to replace his metal “sickles” with silver ones; the next day “a reaper has died  slain by a serrana [tough mountain woman].” —Ed.","Alan Lomax with Jeannette Bell","1952","Westminster","Spanish Recordings  ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection  American Folklife Center  Library of Congress",NA,"nan","Songs and Dances of Spain: Volume 10: Castille.
