Today  it is a strongly hierarchical pastoral culture. The first livestock arrived from Europe around the beginning of the sixteenth century. Hungry  curious  and adventurous  some of the Wayuu obtained livestock by raid and theft until they had semi-wild herds of cattle and horses. Pastoralism progressively became widespread  probably facilitated by missionaries  who made many attempts at pacification; by pirates hostile to the Spanish and in quest of food; and by Black slaves who  by choice or by force  settled among the Wayuu. At the close of the 19th c.  pastoralism was general  supplemented by smuggling  wage labor  and urban remittances.",NA,"@Murdock1967EA @Murdock1968WorldSamplingProvinces @Lomax1989Cantometrics @ArensbergLomax1977Subsistence @Koppen2006UpdatedWorldMap  @Ethnoguc @WikiWayuu  @Glottowayu1243",12,-71.5,NA,NA,"Wayuu","Guajira Peninsula  Colombia/Venezuela",NA,"0:00:35","T5404R57","T1639 C.1","Chicha Song; The Man Who Asked His Grandmother for Chicha","Drinking Song","Song about a man asking his grandmother for more chicha at the Chichamaya Celebration","Francisco  male solo  speaking in background","Male Voice","Men","nan",NA,"Brian Moser","1960-61","Previously Unpublished","Anglo-Colombian Recording Expedition: Music of the Native peoples of Colombia.

The island of Bali is surrounded by coral reefs and the livelihood of its people comes mostly from agriculture and fishing. Religion is the core of Balinese life and there are many rituals and ceremonies observed throughout the year  which are concerned with maintaining a balance between positive and negative forces. Their religion features a mix of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs combined with Balinese animistic traditions. Balinese people believe that good spirits reside in the mountains and demons in the sea.

Hungry  curious  and adventurous  some of the Wayuu obtained livestock by raid and theft until they had semi-wild herds of cattle and horses. Pastoralism progressively became widespread  probably facilitated by missionaries  who made many attempts at pacification; by pirates hostile to the Spanish and in quest of food; and by Black slaves who  by choice or by force  settled among the Wayuu.
